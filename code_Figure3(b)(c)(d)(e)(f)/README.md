# Figure3 (b)(c)(d)(e)(f)

We provide our measurement script.

If you want to reproduce the data, you need to modify the execution path and data path in the script. 

For example, in our PC, the path of `bsdiff` is `/home/emnets/workspace/OTA/algorithms/bsdiff/bsdiff`. Thus, you need to replace it with the actual path on your computer.
