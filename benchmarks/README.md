- 200 apps
  - This folder includes all dataset, including 200 mobile apps.
- 15 representative apps
  - This folder includes 15 apps selected from 200 apps

####  Data description
We provide 200 mobile applications. Each app (i.e., APK) has 5 continuous versions. Thus, we have 1000 unique APKs. 

`appid` : the id of each app.

`First class`: there are two classes, normal (none-game) and game applications.

`Second class`: In normal apps, there are 17 second classes, e.g., Shopping, Travel, and Entertainment.

`version`: the version of each app. A larger number means more freshness.

`url`: Due to the limited storage of Github, we provide the download URL of each APK.
